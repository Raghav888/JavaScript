Custom hooks are replacment for HOC(Higher order function) in functioal components.
In class based components, we use HOC for sharing the same state logic between two components.
Example
1. We have two 2 class components counter1, counter2
2. Both have state for counter value and method for increasing the counter value.
3. Now as the logic is same for increasing the counter and state for it,
we can share that logic between both class components using HOC.
4. In HOC we get one components as input and it returns new component with same logic.
5. HOC can have other parameters as input

So, in functional components custom hooks are introduced as replacement for HOC

1. In custom hook, we create another function that has all the shared logic code and we can it in required components
